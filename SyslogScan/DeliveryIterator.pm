=head1 NAME

SyslogScan::DeliveryIterator -- scans a syslog file for "deliveries",
successful transfers of mail to mailboxes or to other machines.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SyslogScan::Delivery;
    use SyslogScan::DeliveryIterator;
    
    my $iter = new SyslogScan::DeliveryIterator(syslogList =>
						["/var/log/syslog"]);
    
    my $delivery;
    while ($delivery = $iter -> next())
    {
        print $delivery -> summary();
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A DeliveryIterator goes through your sendmail logging file (which may
be /var/log/syslog, /var/adm/messages, or something completely
different) looking for successful deliveries of mail to local
user-accounts or successful transfers of mail to remote machines.

Here is an excerpt from a sample syslog:

Jun 13 01:50:16 satellife sendmail[29556]: DAA29556: from=<shookway@fs1.ho.man.ac.uk>, size=954, class=0, pri=30954, nrcpts=1, msgid=<5B013544E0D@fs1.ho.man.ac.uk>, proto=ESMTP, relay=curlew.cs.man.ac.uk [130.88.13.7]

Jun 13 01:50:17 satellife sendmail[29558]: DAA29556: to=<shoko@time.healthnet.org>, delay=00:00:05, mailer=fidogate, stat=Deferred (Remote host is busy)

...

Jun 13 14:55:50 satellife sendmail[29558]: DAA29556: to=<shoko@time.healthnet.org>, delay=13:00:05, mailer=fidogate, stat=Sent

The delivery is not registered until 14:55:50.  In order to figure out
the size and sender, the iterator needs to have gone over the 'from'
entry associated with message DAA29566, otherwise it will return a
delivery with 'Sender' and 'Size' set to an undefined value (unless
you specified defaults when constructing your DeliveryIterator.)

=head2 METHOD 'NEW'

'new' creates a new iterator.

    my $iter =
        new SyslogScan::DeliveryIterator(startDate => "06.01.96 18:00:00",
					 endDate => "06.02.96 06:00:00",
					 syslogList =>
					 [/var/log/syslog.090696,
					  /var/log/syslog.090796],
					 unknownSender => 'antiquity',
					 unknownSize => 0,
					 defaultYear => 1996);

All of the above parameters are optional.

I<startDate> and I<endDate> define a span of time; we ignore
deliveries that fall before I<startDate> or after I<endDate>.  This
allows you to generate statistical reports about mail delivered over a
given span of time.

I<syslogList> is a list of files to search through for deliveries.
The alternative to specifying syslogList is to supply a file-handle to
a syslog file on each call to the next() method.

I<unknownSender> and I<unknownSize> are what to specify as the sender
and the size if we cannot determine from the logs who sent the message
and how large the message is.

I<defaultYear> is the year in which the deliveries are assumed to have
taken place (this is not specified in the syslog file.)  Default is to
guess the year that makes the delivery take place close to now.  (For
example, if 'now' is February 3rd 1996, then by default a delivery
made on December 14th is assumed to be in 1995, and a delivery made on
February 4th is assumed to be in 1996.

=head2 METHOD 'NEXT'

Once an iterator is defined, the next() method will search for the
next delivery, skipping any deliveries which don't match the time
constraints of I<startDate> and I<endDate>.  There are two ways to
call next():

    # poll syslogList members
    $delivery = $iter -> next;

    # poll filehandle
    open(LOG,"/var/log/syslog");
    $delivery = $iter -> next(\*LOG);

=head2 OTHER OPERATIONS

The 'appendSyslog' method can add a syslog filename to the list
of syslog filenames which were specified at construction time
as 'syslogList'.

Setting the global variable I<$::gbQuiet> to 1 will suppress some
of the error messages to STDERR.

=head1 BUGS

If two messages have the same message ID through a bad coincidence, a
message is produced with sender of 'duplicate' and size of '0' rather
than using the unknownSender and unknownSize parameters.

Sender and receiver address are downcased automatically.  It would
probably be better if this module downcased only the host-name part of
the address and not the user-name.

Some mailings have a 'ctladdr' field; DeliveryIterator should probably
try to parse this as a backup clue for figuring out the sender.
