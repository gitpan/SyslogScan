SyslogScan contains routines to parse system logs.  The package
includes a sample application, read_mail_log.pl, which can print out
various statistics about mail sent and received.

SyslogScan::SyslogLine encapsulates generic log lines in syslog files.

SyslogScan::Delivery encapsulates a delivery of mail from one user to
a list of users.

SyslogScan::Summary generates reports of how much mail each user has
sent and received.

Delivery and Summary information can be efficiently persisted to a
file and recovered for later analysis.
